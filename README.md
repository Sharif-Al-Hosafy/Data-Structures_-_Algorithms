# Data-Structures & Algorithms

My own implementations for various data structures and I'll add some of the interesting problems on each topic while going through

## Topics Coverd

1- Recursion

- Head Recursion
- Tail Recursion
- Tree Recursion
- Indirect Recursion
- Nested Recursion

2- Linked list

- Singly linked lists
- Doubly linked lists
- Circular linked lists
- Circular doubly linked lists

3- Binary Search Tree

- with inorder postorder preorder traversal


4- graph

- BFS & DFS traversal
